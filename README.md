The project is in its initial state and you have been invited to join the development team.
The hospital is an institution that cannot cease to serve for prolonged periods of time,
so the project imposes as a first constraint that the solution must require of minimal
adaptations in the environment.
Other aspects to consider are the security regulations of the institution. One of the
most relevant is the mobility convention. According to this, the mobility must be done
by the right side of the corridors and as close as possible to the walls. In order to
prevent accidents during emergency displacements. Another security requirement is that
any automatic system operating in the institution must prove to rely on a robust error
diagnosis strategy. The system must count on a simple auditing mechanism (for legal
purpose in case of failures or accidents); and be capable of real-time error report to the
responsible technicians.
